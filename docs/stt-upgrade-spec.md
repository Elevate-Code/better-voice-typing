Ok so OpenAI’s Whisper (particularly the largest version, used in the Whisper-1 API) is a widely used baseline for high-quality transcription, and is what we currently use.

However, Whisper has some limitations. It was designed as an offline batch model, meaning it processes entire audio segments and was not initially built for real-time streaming.

## New models

**OpenAI GPT-4 Transcribe (and GPT-4 Mini Transcribe)**

Released in March 2025, OpenAI’s GPT-4 Transcribe models represent the next generation of speech-to-text from OpenAI, surpassing the Whisper series in accuracy.

Unlike Whisper, GPT-4 Transcribe supports real-time streaming transcription in the OpenAI API. It can accept a continuous audio stream and output incremental transcriptions, then finalize with high accuracy once an utterance is complete. The semantic VAD helps implement a hybrid streaming approach – the model streams interim results and knows when to stop and output a final, punctuation-corrected transcript at the end of each spoken turn.

**Google Chirp 2 / Unified Speech Model (USM)**

Google’s Chirp 2 is the latest generation of Google’s dedicated speech-to-text model, built upon their Unified Speech Model (USM) research. USM is a 2 billion-parameter encoder-decoder ASR model trained on 12 million hours of speech in over 300 languages. It powers services like YouTube captions and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. Chirp 2 specifically is offered through Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text v2 API as an enhanced multilingual model, with improvements in accuracy and features over the original Chirp

**Google Gemini Multimodal Models**

Google Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models (announced in late 2023 and improved through 2025) that can accept and generate text, images, and audio. While not a dedicated ASR model, Gemini’s audio transcription ability has proven to be exceptionally strong due to its vast language understanding. To transcribe speech with Gemini, one provides the audio input (e.g. via an API like Vertex AI) along with a prompt (e.g. “Transcribe this audio”). The model then uses its language understanding to produce a transcript

# Integrating OpenAI GPT-4o Transcribe in Python & Multi-Provider STT Architecture

## GPT-4o Transcribe vs Whisper API (Endpoints & Parameters)

OpenAI’s **GPT-4o Transcribe** models (`gpt-4o-transcribe` and the lighter `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`) are new speech-to-text models that outperform the original Whisper model (whisper-1) in accuracy across many languages. They are accessed via **OpenAI’s audio transcription API**, using the same endpoint as Whisper:

* **Endpoint:** `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions` (same endpoint as Whisper-1).
* **Model parameter:** You must specify the model name as `"gpt-4o-transcribe"` or `"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"` instead of `"whisper-1"`. This tells the API to use the new GPT-4o Transcribe model for transcription.

**Supported parameters:** The GPT-4o transcription API uses the same request format as Whisper’s API. Key parameters include:

* **`file`:** The audio file to transcribe (binary content, e.g. WAV, MP3, M4A, or other supported audio formats). This is typically sent as multipart form-data in an HTTP request, or as a file object when using the OpenAI Python SDK.
* **`model`:** The model ID to use (e.g. `"gpt-4o-transcribe"` or `"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"`).
* **`language`:** *(Optional)* ISO-639-1 language code of the spoken language (e.g. `"en"`, `"fr"`). If not provided, the model will auto-detect the language. Providing it can improve accuracy and speed.
* **`prompt`:** *(Optional)* A text prompt to guide transcription (e.g. context or expected vocabulary). This can help bias the transcriber (e.g. “Audio is a tech podcast, expect technical terms”).
* **`response_format`:** *(Optional)* Format for the output. Options include `"text"` (raw transcript text), `"json"` (simple JSON with text), `"verbose_json"` (detailed JSON with segments), or subtitle formats like `"srt"` or `"vtt"`. By default, using the SDK returns a JSON with a `"text"` field containing the transcription.
* **`temperature`:** *(Optional)* A floating-point value (0 to 1) that affects sampling for **Whisper** when multiple transcriptions are requested. (In practice, you will typically leave this at default 0 for deterministic transcription. GPT-4o Transcribe may support this parameter for compatibility, but it primarily returns one high-confidence transcript.)

**Usage differences from Whisper-1:** In terms of API call, using GPT-4o-transcribe is almost identical to Whisper. The main **difference is the `model` name** – everything else (endpoint, request structure) remains the same. However, under the hood GPT-4o offers **higher accuracy and reliability** (lower word error rate) than Whisper, especially on accents or noisy audio. Key points of difference:

* **Accuracy & Language Support:** GPT-4o models have improved word error rate across many languages (particularly those where Whisper struggled). This means transcripts are generally more accurate and handle diverse languages better. They also tend to ignore background noise better and **reduce hallucinations** (transcribing non-speech sounds less often) compared to Whisper.
* **Model Access & Pricing:** Whisper-1 is open-source, but GPT-4o models are closed-source hosted models. They are accessible only via the API (no local run). Pricing is competitive: for example, **`gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` is about half the cost of Whisper’s API** per minute, making it economical. The full `gpt-4o-transcribe` model is more powerful (and likely priced similar to or slightly above Whisper’s rate). *(As of early 2025, Whisper-1 was \~\$0.006/min; GPT-4o-mini is \~\$0.003/min and GPT-4o around Whisper’s price, according to OpenAI’s pricing announcements.)*
* **Feature Limitations:** The new models share similar limitations with the Whisper API. Notably, file uploads are **limited to \~25 MB** in size (roughly \~5-6 minutes of audio in MP3). They also **do not support word-level timestamps or speaker diarization** in their raw output. The output is just the transcribed text (or segments for verbose JSON), without per-word timing or speaker labels, which is the same behavior as the Whisper API. If you need those features, you would still need to handle them separately or use third-party solutions.
* **Translation:** Whisper’s API had a separate endpoint `/v1/audio/translations` for translating speech to English. As of GPT-4o’s release, OpenAI has not announced a separate “translation” model for GPT-4o. The GPT-4o-transcribe is focused on transcribing speech in the *original language*. (You can always take the transcribed text and feed it to a GPT-4 model or translation API if translation is needed, but there isn’t an out-of-the-box direct translation mode like Whisper had.)
* **Real-time Streaming:** Perhaps the biggest new capability is that GPT-4o models support **real-time streaming transcription**, whereas Whisper’s API was only non-streaming. OpenAI introduced a Realtime API (WebSocket-based) alongside GPT-4o for low-latency transcription. We detail this below – it allows GPT-4o to produce incremental transcripts in real time, which Whisper-1 did not offer via the HTTP endpoint (Whisper was strictly batch via /v1/audio/transcriptions).

In summary, **to use GPT-4o Transcribe via HTTP API**, you call the **same endpoint** as Whisper with the new model name and the usual parameters. For example, using the OpenAI Python SDK (v1.68.0+):

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

with open("audio_file.wav", "rb") as audio:
    transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe(
        model="gpt-4o-transcribe",
        file=audio,
        language="en",        # optional language hint
        prompt="Meeting about project X"  # optional prompt
    )
print(transcript['text'])
```

This will upload the audio file and return a transcription. In the SDK, `openai.Audio.transcribe` handles the POST under the hood. By default the result is a Python dict; `transcript['text']` contains the transcribed text. You can request other `response_format` if needed (e.g., `"srt"` for subtitles).

## Batch vs Streaming: Transcription Processing Modes

When integrating speech-to-text, you have a few modes of operation to balance **latency** vs **completeness** of transcripts:

1. **Full Batch Mode (upload complete file, get complete transcript):** This is the traditional approach – you record or have an entire audio file, send it to OpenAI’s API, and wait for the full transcription result. The GPT-4o API fully supports this mode via the HTTP endpoint `/v1/audio/transcriptions`. Just like Whisper-1, you can upload a whole file (up to the size limit) and get back the full transcript in one response. This approach is simple but has the highest latency for long audio, since transcription only starts after you send the whole file and you get no feedback until it's done. It’s suitable for pre-recorded files or short snippets. **Example:** sending a 30-second voice memo file and receiving the text once processing completes.

2. **Hybrid Mode (stream input, final transcript at end):** In this mode, you **stream audio in real-time to the server** to begin processing sooner, but you only care about the **final, accurate transcript after each segment** (you don’t necessarily display interim results to the user). The idea is to reduce overall latency by processing audio as it’s recorded, yet still present only polished output. GPT-4o Transcribe **can support this pattern** using the new Realtime API. Essentially, you open a WebSocket connection for transcription (documented by OpenAI as the Realtime transcription session) and send audio chunks as the user speaks. The GPT-4o model will process streaming audio and internally produce incremental results, but you can choose to ignore the “partial” messages and wait for the **completion event** for each utterance. The completion event delivers the finalized transcript for that segment (with any necessary corrections or context adjustments applied).

   *How to implement:* You would use the same real-time streaming setup as in mode 3 (described below) – i.e., connect via WebSocket and send audio in chunks – but your client logic could suppress showing interim text. Instead, rely on the `...transcription.completed` event (which GPT-4o emits at the end of a speech turn) to get the final transcript. This “hybrid” approach is essentially a **usage pattern** on top of the streaming API: you get the benefit of lower latency (transcription is happening as audio arrives, not after the fact) but present only the end result to the user. There isn’t a separate REST endpoint for this; you still use the Realtime WebSocket endpoint with intent=transcription, but you handle the events differently on the client side (ignoring the incremental `delta` events).

   > **Note:** Some STT systems use the term “buffered” mode or two-pass mode for a similar idea (first pass streaming, second pass refine). GPT-4o’s streaming API **automatically refines** transcripts by the end of an utterance. Partial `delta` transcripts may be slightly imperfect or incomplete, but the final `completed` transcript for that segment is the refined result. So simply waiting for the completion event yields an accurate transcript with minimal delay.

3. **Full Real-Time Streaming (continuous partial & final transcriptions):** This mode provides **instant, on-the-fly transcription** as audio is being spoken. As audio streams in, the API returns partial transcripts in near-real-time (allowing live subtitles or interactive voice applications). GPT-4o Transcribe **supports full streaming** via OpenAI’s **Realtime API**. You establish a persistent WebSocket connection to the OpenAI server and send audio data incrementally (e.g., every few milliseconds of PCM audio) rather than one big file. The server responds with events containing transcribed text as it’s recognized.

   OpenAI’s Realtime API for transcription sends two main event types:

   * **`...transcription.delta` events:** incremental partial transcripts, updated as the model processes incoming audio. For GPT-4o, these events stream out pieces of text continuously (e.g., a few words at a time) with very low latency.
   * **`...transcription.completed` events:** a final transcript for a segment, emitted when the model detects the end of a spoken utterance (pause or end of input). This is the definitive transcript for that segment of audio. After this, the model will start listening for the next segment.

   **WebSocket Endpoint:** To use streaming, you connect to OpenAI’s realtime service. For OpenAI’s cloud, the endpoint is for example:
   `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?intent=transcription`
   along with appropriate headers (including your `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` and a header to enable the beta realtime API if needed, e.g. `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1`). Once connected, you send a JSON message to initialize a **transcription session** specifying the model and options, then continually send audio chunks (usually PCM16 or base64-encoded audio frames) as `input_audio_buffer.append` events. The server then starts replying with the `delta` and `completed` events described above.

   **Capabilities:** GPT-4o’s streaming transcription is highly responsive – you’ll see words appear as you speak. Unlike Whisper in streaming (which only output after each pause), GPT-4o truly streams partial results in real time. For example, if you say “Hello, how are you doing today?”, the client might receive a delta event with `"Hello,"` then `"Hello, how are you"` then `"Hello, how are you doing today?"` and finally a completed event `"Hello, how are you doing today?"` once you finish speaking. This allows building live captioning or voice assistant features with minimal delay.

   **Requirements:** To implement mode 3, you’ll typically use an async WebSocket client (the OpenAI Python SDK does *not* yet have high-level helpers for the real-time audio API, so you might use Python’s `websockets` or `websocket-client`). You also need to capture microphone audio in real time (e.g. via `sounddevice` or `pyaudio`) and feed it into the WebSocket. OpenAI’s documentation provides a structure for the JSON messages (model name, language, noise\_reduction settings, etc.) when starting a session.

**Does GPT-4o support modes 2 and 3?** Yes – GPT-4o Transcribe was designed with real-time usage in mind. Mode 3 (full streaming) is fully supported through the Realtime WebSocket API, which can deliver partial *and* final transcripts with very low latency. Mode 2 (hybrid) is effectively a subset of the streaming capability – you can achieve it by using the streaming endpoint but only utilizing final results. There is no separate “hybrid” endpoint; it’s about how you handle the stream. For example, you might enable Voice Activity Detection (VAD) on the server (or client) so that the API automatically determines when a user has finished speaking and returns a `completed` event. Your application can ignore the interim `delta` events and just take the final `completed` transcript for each segment – thereby giving the user a rapid but clean transcription after each pause.

If you do not need real-time feedback, you could also simulate a hybrid approach by chunking a long audio into smaller pieces and sending each chunk to `/v1/audio/transcriptions` separately to get partial results faster, but this is not ideal – you’d lose cross-chunk context and have to stitch results. It’s better to use the Realtime API for any scenario where audio is coming in live or you want to process before the entire file is available.

**Summary:** GPT-4o Transcribe supports both **batch** and **real-time** transcription. The **/v1/audio/transcriptions** endpoint covers batch mode (complete file in, one response out). For **streaming** (modes 2 & 3), you’ll use the new **Realtime WebSocket API** with GPT-4o models. Whisper-1 was limited to batch mode (and in the Realtime API, Whisper would only return after each full utterance, not truly word-by-word streaming), whereas GPT-4o enables true streaming partial results. This is a key upgrade for latency-critical applications.

## Designing a Flexible Multi-Provider STT Framework (Architecture)

When building a desktop transcription app, it’s wise to architect it such that you can **swap between different speech-to-text providers** (OpenAI, Google Cloud, local Whisper, etc.) without rewriting your core logic. The goal is to keep the **main application (`voice_typing.pyw`) decoupled from provider-specific code**, using a modular design. Two design patterns that are useful here are the **Strategy Pattern** and the **Factory Pattern**:

* **Strategy Pattern:** This pattern lets you define a family of algorithms (in our case, transcription strategies for different providers) and make them interchangeable at runtime. The idea is to have a common interface for transcription, and each provider implements that interface. The main code doesn’t hardcode which algorithm (provider) to use – it selects one based on configuration. This keeps the logic flexible and follows the Open/Closed Principle (the system is open to adding new providers, closed to modifying the core logic each time).

* **Factory Pattern:** A factory is useful for creating the appropriate provider service object based on some parameter (e.g., a provider name or ID). Instead of littering the code with `if/elif` or switch statements to choose a provider, a factory can encapsulate that decision. The main app just asks the factory for a transcriber object for “OpenAI” or “Google”, and gets back an instance that implements the transcription interface.

**Project structure:** Following the hints given, you can organize the code as follows:

```
modules/
    transcribe.py    # High-level module for transcription routing
    settings.py      # Configuration (e.g., default provider/model settings)
services/
    openai_stt.py    # Implementation of OpenAI STT service
    google_stt.py    # Implementation of Google Cloud STT service
    azure_stt.py     # (etc., one per provider as needed)
```

In `modules/settings.py`, you might have configuration like:

```python
# Example settings.py
DEFAULT_STT_PROVIDER = "openai"
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-transcribe"      # default model to use for OpenAI STT
GOOGLE_STT_LANGUAGE = "en-US"           # example: default language for Google STT
# ... other provider-specific settings ...
```

This allows central management of which provider is active or any provider-specific options. You might later expose this in a GUI or config file so the user can choose a provider or model.

**Service classes (Strategy implementations):** In each `services/xyz_stt.py`, define a class or function that knows how to call that provider’s API. For example, `services/openai_stt.py` could define an `OpenAITranscriber` class:

```python
# services/openai_stt.py
import openai
from modules import settings

class OpenAITranscriber:
    def __init__(self):
        openai.api_key = settings.OPENAI_API_KEY  # assume set somewhere secure
        self.model = settings.OPENAI_MODEL        # e.g. "gpt-4o-transcribe"

    def transcribe(self, audio_data: bytes) -> str:
        # audio_data could be raw bytes or a file path; adapt as needed
        response = openai.Audio.transcribe(model=self.model, file=audio_data)
        return response['text']
```

Likewise, `services/google_stt.py` might use Google’s Speech-to-Text API (perhaps via the Google Cloud client library or HTTP requests):

```python
# services/google_stt.py
import requests
from modules import settings

class GoogleTranscriber:
    def __init__(self):
        self.language = settings.GOOGLE_STT_LANGUAGE  # e.g. "en-US"
        # ... any other Google API setup (auth credentials, etc.)
    def transcribe(self, audio_data: bytes) -> str:
        # Make HTTP request to Google Cloud STT (or use google cloud library)
        # For illustration, assume a REST call:
        response = requests.post(
            url="https://speech.googleapis.com/v1p1beta1/speech:recognize",
            headers={...auth...},
            json={
                "config": {"languageCode": self.language},
                "audio": {"content": audio_data.decode('base64')}  # if base64 encoded
            }
        )
        text = response.json()['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript']
        return text
```

Each service module encapsulates the details of interacting with that provider (API calls, auth, formatting). All have a common method (e.g. `transcribe(audio_data) -> text`) so they can be used interchangeably.

**Transcription router (Context + Factory):** Now, in `modules/transcribe.py`, implement the logic to select and invoke the appropriate service. This acts as both the *Strategy context* and using a simple factory to choose the strategy:

```python
# modules/transcribe.py
from modules import settings

# Import all provider classes (you could do dynamic import too)
from services.openai_stt import OpenAITranscriber
from services.google_stt import GoogleTranscriber
# ... import other providers as needed ...

# Simple factory to get a transcriber instance based on provider name
def _get_transcriber(provider_name: str):
    if provider_name == "openai":
        return OpenAITranscriber()
    elif provider_name == "google":
        return GoogleTranscriber()
    # add other providers here...
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown STT provider: {provider_name}")

def transcribe_audio(audio_data: bytes) -> str:
    """Transcribe audio using the configured provider."""
    provider = settings.DEFAULT_STT_PROVIDER
    transcriber = _get_transcriber(provider)
    # Use the selected strategy to transcribe
    return transcriber.transcribe(audio_data)
```

In the above design, `transcribe_audio` is the high-level function the rest of your app calls. It looks up the default provider from settings, gets an appropriate Transcriber object via the factory function, and calls its `transcribe` method. This is effectively a Strategy pattern in action – the `transcriber` object’s class can vary (OpenAI, Google, etc.), but it’s used through a uniform interface. If you need to support *multiple* providers dynamically (say the user can choose at runtime), you could extend `transcribe_audio` to accept a `provider_name` argument or have a function to set the current strategy.

**Decoupling from the main app:** Now, in your main application code (`voice_typing.pyw`), you **do not need to import any provider-specific modules**. You simply use the high-level interface:

```python
# voice_typing.pyw
from modules import transcribe

# ... code to record or obtain audio_data (e.g., using sounddevice) ...
audio_data = record_audio_chunk()  # however you implement recording

# Get transcription (this will route to the chosen provider under the hood)
text = transcribe.transcribe_audio(audio_data)
display_text(text)  # update the UI with the transcribed text
```

The main app doesn’t know or care whether the text came from OpenAI or Google or another service. This makes it easy to switch providers – e.g., if the user changes a setting to use Google instead of OpenAI, you’d just change `settings.DEFAULT_STT_PROVIDER` (and perhaps some API keys), and the rest of the app remains unchanged.

Adding a new provider in the future (say Azure STT or IBM Watson) would involve **creating a new service module** (implementing the `transcribe` method for that API) and **adding one case in the factory** (or you can make the factory automatically discover classes via naming conventions to avoid even modifying it). This approach adheres to the open/closed principle by not requiring changes in the higher-level logic for new extensions.

**Lightweight design considerations:**

* The architecture uses basic Python modules and classes – no heavy frameworks required. This keeps it lightweight. The use of design patterns here is mostly about code organization rather than introducing any new dependencies. The app will use libraries like `openai` for OpenAI’s API, `requests` or the specific SDK for others, and possibly `sounddevice` for audio capture, but each is used in isolation within its module.

* **No global switches in logic:** Avoid peppering the code with `if provider == X: ... elif provider == Y: ...` in many places (that becomes hard to maintain). By centralizing the decision in `transcribe.py`, you have a single switch point (or a mapping) to choose the strategy. Everywhere else, you call a generic function or method.

* **Threading/async:** If you implement streaming (real-time) transcription in the future, you might extend this pattern similarly – e.g., an `OpenAITranscriber` might have a method to start a streaming session. You could design an interface for both batch and streaming modes. For now, if the app is mostly batch (record then transcribe), the above structure works synchronously. If using real-time streaming, you may need to manage background threads or async IO (as suggested by OpenAI’s examples using an audio thread plus WebSocket async loop), but those details can be handled inside the `services/openai_stt.py` implementation for streaming. The main app could still just initiate it via a high-level call (e.g., `transcriber.start_stream()` and get callbacks for transcripts). The key is to isolate those complexities in the provider-specific class.

* **Using `litellm`:** If you are using the `litellm` library in your app (perhaps to interface with language models uniformly), note that `litellm` focuses on LLMs and OpenAI-compatible endpoints. You likely won’t use `litellm` for speech-to-text directly, since STT is a different kind of service. However, the modular approach here aligns well with that philosophy – each provider is handled through a consistent interface. You could even create a `LitellmTranscriber` if `litellm` offered a unified STT interface (though currently it’s more for text completions). In any case, our design remains compatible with the rest of the app and libraries: the main voice typing logic is ignorant of whether we used raw `openai` or `litellm` or anything under the hood.

**Conclusion:** By applying a Strategy pattern with a Factory for instantiation, you create a **flexible STT framework** where providers are plug-and-play. The main application code calls a high-level function to transcribe audio, and the choice of provider is determined by configuration (and can be changed without code changes in the main app). Each provider’s integration (OpenAI via `openai` SDK, Google via REST/SDK, etc.) lives in its own module under `services/`, making the codebase organized and maintainable. This ensures your `voice_typing.pyw` remains clean and decoupled from provider-specific details, and you can easily extend or switch speech recognition backends as needed in the future.
