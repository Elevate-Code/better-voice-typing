# Voice Typing Assistant

A lightweight Python desktop app for Windows that improves upon Windows Voice Typing (Win+H) by offering superior transcription accuracy while maintaining a simple, intuitive interface.

![Voice Typing Demo](voice-typing-demo.gif)

## Overview

The app works as follows:
- Press Caps Lock to begin recording your voice (without activating Caps Lock)
- A small red indicator appears in the top-right corner showing "ðŸŽ¤ Recording"
- Audio level visualization shows your current input volume
- Press Caps Lock again to stop recording and process the audio
- The audio is sent to OpenAI Whisper for transcription
- (beta, optional) The transcribed text is cleaned and inserted at the cursor location
- The transcribed text is automatically inserted at your current cursor position in any text field or editor
- Settings and recent transcriptions can be accessed via the system tray icon

## Features

### Controls
- **Toggle Recording**: Caps Lock (normal Caps Lock functionality still available with Ctrl+Caps Lock)
- **Cancel Recording**: Click the recording indicator

### Tray Options/Settings
- Recent Transcriptions: Access previous transcriptions, copy to clipboard
- Continuous Capture: Default recording mode. Record audio until the user stops it, send it all at once to OpenAI Whisper
- (beta) Clean Transcription: Enable/disable text cleaning using Anthropic Claude Haiku


### Tray History
- Keeps track of recent transcriptions
- Useful if your cursor was in the wrong place at the time of insertion
- Quick access to copy previous transcriptions from system tray

## Technical Details
- Minimal UI built with Python tkinter
- OpenAI Whisper API for transcription (will support other providers in the future)
- For now, only tested on Windows OS and Python 3.8+

## Current Limitations
- Maximum recording duration of ~10 minutes per transcription due to OpenAI Whisper API's 25MB file size limit
- Currently uses system default microphone with no in-app selection option

## Setup/Installation - For Users

### Quick Start (Windows)
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download this project by clicking the green "Code" button above â†’ "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice
4. Double-click the `setup.bat` file to automatically:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install required packages
   - Set up your configuration file
5. When prompted, paste your OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
6. Double-click `voice_typing.pyw` to start the app
7. **Important**: Ensure the app's tray icon is visible by right-clicking the taskbar â†’ "Taskbar settings" â†’ "Select which icons appear on the taskbar" â†’ Toggle on for Voice Typing Assistant (the tray icon is the main interface for settings and status)
8. **Recommended**: Right-click `voice_typing.pyw` â†’ Send to â†’ Desktop to create a shortcut

### Auto-start with Windows
To make the app start automatically when Windows boots:
1. Press `Win + R` on your keyboard
2. Type `shell:startup` and press Enter
3. Drag your `voice_typing.pyw` shortcut into this folder

### Updating the App
To update to the latest version:
1. Double-click `setup.bat`
2. Choose 'Y' when asked to check for updates
3. The tool will automatically:
   - Download the latest version
   - Preserve your settings and API keys
   - Update all dependencies
4. Restart the app if it was running

## Setup/Installation - For Developers

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
3. Run `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
5. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` by running `cp .env.example .env`
6. Set up your API keys:
   - Get an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - (Optional) Get an Anthropic API key if you want to use the text cleaning feature
   - Add these keys to your `.env` file
7. Run the app by double-clicking `voice_typing.pyw`, and add a shortcut to your startup folder to launch automatically on system boot

## TODO
- [x] Do not send audio to OpenAI if the audio is silent or too short (<2 seconds)
- [x] Add visual status indicators via UI feedback indicator/overlay AND tray icon to show state (recording/processing/done/error)
- [x] Add microphone selection via system tray menu (currently locked to system default)
- [x] Manual (later, auto) retry option for failed transcriptions via tray menu and using overlay (especially important for longer recordings)
- [x] Add feature to auto-stop on complete silence, like when mic settings aren't configured properly.
- [ ] Review and validate setup and installation process
- [ ] Customizable activation shortcuts for recording control
- [ ] Improved transcription accuracy for code variables, proper nouns and abbreviations using screenshot context and cursor position via VLM
- [ ] Smart Capture: Record audio in 1-2 minute chunks with silence detection, process chunks with Whisper in background, then combine and clean results with an LLM
